    <h2>Information for Beginners</h2>
    <font size="6">
<p>Stocks-can be volatile depending on how many shares are bought per day
i.e. overall investor sentiment. Economic stances such as recessions and 
inflation will determine buying and trading. Please know that there are
options to self manage stocks and that there is usually a flat rate fee that must
be paid per trade when using an online trading service. On top of that, buying 
stock in Company X means that you are part owner of said company and are entitled to voting rights.</p>


<p>Mutual funds-consists of a variety of stocks and tend to range 
from $2000+. They are not so volatile because mutual funds are very liquidated 
meaning that the loss of value in one stock may not be felt due to the majority of
stocks increasing in that fund. Mutual Funds are typically managed by some sort of investment
banker, there is an added percentage fee taken out of your account and given to the broker.</p>
